# sveDEX-UI

Svelte port of [GitSquared/edex-ui](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui).

A nearly full svelte port of eDEX UI. Settings wise should support mostly everything.

## Why

Svelte is cool and I wanted some practice with it.

## Known differences

- Keybinds don't work
- Not all settings might work (mainly filesystem related settings).
- Audio and video files cannot be opened directly (shift click to write into terminal). There were missing icons I didn't add yet.
- Less frequent updates for system info. Uses less CPU that way.
